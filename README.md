### Overview of "Containers" classes

| Container name | Description                                                                                                                           |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Set            | Associative container that contains a sorted set of unique objects of type Key.                                                       |
| Multiset       | Associative container that contains a sorted set of objects of type Key.                                                              |
| Map            | Sorted associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys.                                                          |
| List           | Container that supports constant time insertion and removal of elements from anywhere in the container.                               |
| Stack          | Container adaptor that gives the programmer the functionality of a stack - specifically, a LIFO (last-in, first-out) data structure.  |
| Queue          | Container adaptor that gives the programmer the functionality of a queue - specifically, a FIFO (first-in, first-out) data structure. |
| Vector         | Sequence container that encapsulates dynamic size arrays.                                                                             |
| Array          | Container that encapsulates fixed size arrays.                                                                                        |
